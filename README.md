## What is a Rubik's Cube?
A 3x3 Rubikâ€™s Cube is a cube with 6 faces, each face made up of 9 smaller squares (3x3 grid). Each face is one solid color when solved. The puzzle is scrambled by randomly rotating its sides, mixing up the colored stickers. The goal is to restore the cube to its original solved state where each face has a uniform color.
